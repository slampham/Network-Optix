Person takes the train home from the station at random times (true randomness, not pseudo-random). Both train A and train B shows up at the station at intervals of 3 minutes exactly. He notices that he takes train A twice as much as train B. Why?

Assumptions:
  - Same number of trains, same speed, same distance
  - If train shows up at 3:00 and person shows up at 3:00, he takes that train
  - If train shows up at 3:00 and person shows up at 3:01, he takes subsequent train

Solution:
  Suppose train B leaves exactly at [3:01, 3:04, 3:07, ...] and train A at [3:00, 3:03, 3:06, ...].
  Then train B would have half the available time for person to show up and ride compared to train A.
