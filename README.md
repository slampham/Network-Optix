> Add any number of images on the layout, move them, resize, remove, and reorder as you like

## Technologies
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
* **Libraries**: styled-components (CSS-in-JS), react-grid-layout
* **Deployment**: AWS Amplify

## General info
You may add any number of images onto the layout, although I do notice that it starts to lag heavily after 15-20 images are added. It is also mobile responsive so the grid system will automatically adjust depending on the viewport.
